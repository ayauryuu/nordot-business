1) How many users do you currently have who refers to the contents that you curate?
2) If I may ask, how is the revenue generated so far?
3) You mentioned the % ratio as 61.8% for content owner. How much would that be (rough estimate)?
4) Are the transactions made in USD or JPY?
5) How much articles do you require us to upload to you? Or would you obtain them from KND Indonesia who we currently supply our content to?
6) Pertaining to question 5, if we upload the articles, how many would you need and is it done on a daily basis?
