1) How many users do you currently have who refers to the contents that you curate?
-> We have over 100 millions montly pageviews generated from our service. 

2) If I may ask, how is the revenue generated so far?
-> Revenue is generated from ads. We have our SSP, connected to selected adnetworks and ad exchanges. Our CPM is around $5, so say you join our platform as a content provider and receive 1,000,000 PVs, then you receive $5000 x 0.618 - 19%
fee. $2,502 would be your revenue. 

3) You mentioned the % ratio as 61.8% for content owner. How much would that be (rough estimate)?

4) Are the transactions made in USD or JPY?
5) How much articles do you require us to upload to you? Or would you obtain them from KND Indonesia who we currently supply our content to?
6) Pertaining to question 5, if we upload the articles, how many would you need and is it done on a daily basis?
