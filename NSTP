-> Revenue is generated from ads. We run SSP, connected to selected adnetworks, ad exchanges, and DSPs. Our CPM is around $5 at the moment.

Yes, let's say that you receive 1,000,000 PVs and our CPM $5, then your revenue share would be:
$5,000 x 0.618 - 19% service fee = $2,502

Made in JPY but we will pay you in your local currency.

We don't have any minimum number requirement so whatever you have available would be fine. We can absolutely obtain your content via KND. Currently you feed them only paid content, so could you please add free content in the same format and make sure to flag, utilizing <category>?

6) Pertaining to question 5, if we upload the articles, how many would you need and is it done on a daily basis?
Again, we don't set any minimum requirement. How many per day do you think you could provide so we know?
